# Pipeline DSL

Welcome to the Pipeline DSL section of KraftShade documentation. This section covers the Domain Specific Language (DSL) used to create and configure shader pipelines in KraftShade.

## Overview

The Pipeline DSL is a powerful feature of KraftShade that allows you to:

- Create complex shader pipelines with minimal boilerplate code
- Chain multiple shaders together in various configurations
- Configure shader parameters and inputs in a type-safe way
- Create reusable pipeline components

## Key Concepts

The Pipeline DSL includes several key components:

- [Introduction](./introduction): An overview of the Pipeline DSL and its benefits
- [Serial Pipeline](./serial-pipeline): Creating linear chains of shaders
- [Graph Pipeline](./graph-pipeline): Creating more complex, non-linear shader graphs
- [Nested Pipeline](./nested-pipeline): Composing pipelines within pipelines
- [Best Practices](./best-practices): Guidelines for effective pipeline creation

## Getting Started

If you're new to KraftShade, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start-guide) to see the Pipeline DSL in action with simple examples.
