# Core Components

Welcome to the Core Components section of KraftShade documentation. This section covers the fundamental building blocks that make up the KraftShade framework.

## Overview

KraftShade is built around several core components that work together to provide a powerful and flexible shader pipeline system:

- [GLEnv](./glenv): The OpenGL environment that manages the rendering context
- [Input System](./input-system): Handles various types of inputs to shaders
- [Shader System](./shader-system/kraft-shader): The foundation for creating and managing shaders
- Pipeline System: Connects shaders together to create complex effects

## Getting Started

If you're new to KraftShade, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start-guide) to get a basic understanding of how these components work together.
