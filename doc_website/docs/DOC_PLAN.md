- Document all Built-in Shaders
- Add more comprehensive examples

### Phase 3: Advanced Documentation
- Complete Advanced Topics
- Add detailed tutorials
- Create API reference documentation

## Revision Process

### Document Review and Linking

As part of the ongoing documentation maintenance, we regularly review existing content and add appropriate links between related documents. This process includes:

1. **Review**: Examine all existing documentation for accuracy, completeness, and clarity
2. **Identify Connections**: Identify relationships between different documents and concepts
3. **Add Links**: Add cross-references and links between related documents
4. **Update DOC_PLAN.md**: Document new connections and update the documentation plan

This review and linking process will be performed:
- After completing each documentation phase
- When adding significant new content
- Periodically (quarterly) to ensure documentation cohesion
