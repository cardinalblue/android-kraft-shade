## AI Documentation Guidelines

This section provides guidelines for AI agents assisting with KraftShade documentation.

### Core Principles

- **Code-First Approach**: Always check the actual code implementation before documenting any feature or API. Documentation must accurately reflect the current implementation, not theoretical or planned features.

- **Verify API Usage**: Confirm the actual way APIs are used by examining the codebase. Look for:
  - Method signatures and parameters
  - Return types and values
  - Exception handling patterns
  - Usage patterns in test cases and examples

- **No Fabrication**: Do not make up or assume the existence of:
  - DSLs that aren't in the codebase
  - Classes or methods that don't exist
  - Parameters or options not supported by the implementation
  - Features mentioned in comments but not actually implemented

- **Find Real Examples**: Source examples directly from the repository:
  - Prioritize examples from test cases and demo applications
  - Reference actual implementation code when appropriate
  - Ensure examples are complete and functional
  - Verify examples work with the current API version

- **Visual Documentation**: Use diagrams to enhance understanding:
  - Use Mermaid graphs for:
    - Architecture overviews
    - Pipeline flows
    - Process sequences
    - Decision trees for complex operations
  - **Important Note**: Do not use class diagrams. Instead, provide clear and precise textual descriptions of components and their relationships.
  - **Color Consistency**: Use the following color scheme for all diagrams to maintain visual consistency:
    - Core Components: `fill:#c73,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,font-size:24px,font-weight:bold,white-space: nowrap`
    - View Components: `fill:#27c,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,font-size:24px,font-weight:bold,white-space: nowrap`
    - DSL Layer: `fill:#3c3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,font-size:24px,font-weight:bold,white-space: nowrap`
    - Pipeline System: `fill:#93c,stroke:#933,stroke-width:4px,stroke-dasharray: 5 2`
  - Choose the appropriate diagram type:
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
      A[Choose Diagram Type] --> B{What are you documenting?}
      B -->|Process Flow| C[Flowchart]
      B -->|Sequence of Operations| E[Sequence Diagram]
      B -->|State Transitions| F[State Diagram]
    ```
  - For component relationships that would traditionally use class diagrams, provide structured textual descriptions that clearly explain:
    - Component names and purposes
    - Hierarchical relationships (inheritance/implementation)
    - Compositional relationships
    - Dependencies between components
    - Key methods and properties (when relevant)

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Research Phase**:
   - Examine relevant code files
   - Review tests and examples
   - Identify key classes, methods, and patterns
   - Note any discrepancies between code and existing docs

2. **Verification Phase**:
   - Confirm behavior through test cases
   - Verify parameter types and constraints
   - Check for edge cases and error handling
   - Identify dependencies and requirements

3. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Structure content logically
   - Include verified code examples
   - Add appropriate diagrams
   - Link to related documentation
   - Include troubleshooting guidance

4. **Review Phase**:
   - Check accuracy against code
   - Ensure completeness
   - Verify diagram correctness
   - Confirm terminology consistency

### Best Practices

- Document both "how" and "why" - explain implementation details and the reasoning behind them
- Include common pitfalls and their solutions
- Provide progressive examples from basic to advanced usage
- Use consistent terminology that matches the codebase
- Highlight performance considerations and optimization opportunities
- Include version information when documenting evolving APIs
